    Emby's remote playback commands are fire-and-forget over the client's
    websocket connection — confirmed against upstream Jellyfin source (which
    shares the same session/command protocol design): no acknowledgment, no
    retry, and the server's own session state is only updated when the client
    separately reports back. See
    `.agents/tasks/26-p2-emby-source-client-keeps-stale-paused-playback-screen.md`.
    A dropped Stop leaves the source client's own "now playing" screen frozen
    until Emby's session list eventually expires it client-side. Sending it
    twice, immediately, is the minimal mitigation available for a protocol
    with no delivery guarantee — not a workaround for a bug HCC could
    otherwise fix. This is the one place that owns that redundancy: every
    caller that needs the source client's screen to actually clear (handoff,
    and playback finish, for every `PlaybackOrigin`) calls this once and gets
    both sends — a caller doing its own single send and expecting this
    function to merely add a second one is the gap that let the screen freeze
    return for the `REMOTE_CONTROL_COMMAND` origin (see CHANGELOG).
